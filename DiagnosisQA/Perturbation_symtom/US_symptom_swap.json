When she asked him why he no longer talks to his friends, she states that he told her, “They already know where I am. They can see me.

The patient’s mother has become increasingly concerned about him since his high school graduation. Although she says that he had been an excellent student in high school, his grades have begun slipping in his second year in college, and he no longer socializes with friends. When she asked him why he no longer talks to his friends, she states that he told her, “They already know where I am. They can see me. They watch me from my bedroom window, so they already know what I’m doing. We don’t need to talk.” She found this to be bizarre, as nearly all of his friends live hours away. The patient states that he feels fine and doesn’t understand why everyone thinks he is crazy. The psychiatrist notices reduced spontaneous movements while the patient is speaking and that he speaks in a monotone with a voice that is soft in volume. He also appears suspicious and defensive, asking the psychiatrist “why are you asking me that?” after each evaluative question. His mood is generally flat with little reactivity or engagement during the course of his interview, but he denies any symptoms of depression or psychosis. No significant past medical history. Family history is not available as he was adopted. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?"}
